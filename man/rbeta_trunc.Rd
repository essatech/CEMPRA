\title{Sample from Truncated Beta Distribution}
\usage{
rbeta_trunc(n, mean, sd, lower, upper)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of samples to draw.}

\item{mean}{Numeric. Mean value (must be between 0 and 1 for standard beta).}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation.}

\item{lower}{Numeric. Lower bound for truncation.}

\item{upper}{Numeric. Upper bound for truncation.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of n samples from the truncated beta distribution.
}
\description{
Sample from a beta distribution with truncation to specified bounds.
Uses the existing beta_param() function to convert mean/sd to shape parameters.
}
\details{
Uses the beta_param() function to estimate alpha and beta parameters
from mean and sd, then samples and truncates to bounds. For values outside
\link{0,1}, the function adjusts the sampling appropriately.
