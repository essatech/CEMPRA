\title{Population Model Matrix Elements for Anadromous Fish}
\usage{
pop_model_matrix_elements_anadromous(pop_mod_setup = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop_mod_setup}{List. Object returned from population_model_setup_anadromous(). Use pop_model_matrix_elements() for objects returned from population_model_setup().}
}
\value{
a list object of symbolic objects.
}
\description{
Build population model matrix elements for anadromous fish.
}
\details{
This is an intermediate setup function to run the population model. However, some of outputs are useful on their own, especially for eigen analyses. pop_model_matrix_elements() is run after pop_model_setup() or pop_model_setup_anadromous(), but pop_model_matrix_elements() must be run before Projection_DD(). Key outputs to explore include a density independent projection matrix, life histories, and a symbolic representation of the matrix math for density dependent and density independent components. population_model_setup() should be run with pop_model_matrix_elements() for non-anadromous species. population_model_setup_anadromous() should be run with pop_model_matrix_elements_anadromous() for anadromous species.
